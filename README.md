## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to illustrate my journey of learning website design with HTML and CSS code. The website displays many different concepts learned throughout my Web Dev class such as responsive design, acessibility, viewports, navigaion menus, and a form. In repsonsive design we learned to make the website disply differently on different forms of media whether it be phone, table, or laptop.  With Acessibility we learned the importance of having a good color scheme is key for those with color blindness as well as having alt tags to assits the blind in being able to get an idea as to what our photos are. Viewports allow us to show information or videos from other websites on our own website in order to give the user differnt information such as a relevent YouTube video. With the navigation menu we mad e the website more easily navigate by taking you to the desired section in the click of a button. Finally we added a form at the bottom that takes the data input of the website user and converts it into xml so we can manipulate it they way we need to.

Most of this code has been done through my own means, meaning I did not copy and paste any existing code for everything      other than my Navigation menu.
