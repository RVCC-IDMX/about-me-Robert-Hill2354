        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>

            &emsp; I am a Information Systems and Technology Major at Raritan Valley community college.
            My current job is at RVCC at a Senior Student Aide in Tech Services. Before I attended RVCC I Went to Warren County
            Technical School for my High School and I majored in Engineering this has clearly changed. While I was there I competed in a State competition
            between Technical Schools called Skills USA and won Gold Which took us to Nationals. During my youth between the ages of 11 and
            18 I was a youth memeber of the Boy Scouts of America where I earned my Eagle Scout Rank and was a memebr of The Order of the 
            Arrow. For my Eagle Scout project which is the most difficult and time consuming of the requiments for Eagle Scout I put in granite 
            benches at my local 9/11 memorial. Currently I am about to graduate from RVCC with a AS in Information Systems and Technology and 
            I will be moving on to finish my Bachelors at a to be determined online School.

        <h2>CSS Animation</h2>

            <div>
                    <p> &emsp;One of the many interesting capabilities of CSS is its ability to animate objects within itself. 
                    This is particularly useful when you want to add a little bit of interesting elements to your otherwise simple website. 
                    Not only does it make the website look better it’s also got a few other benefits on it’s side. The first is that it is so 
                    simple it doesn’t even require an outside coding language like Java to work. Next Even with a moderate load on your system 
                    the animation will still run beautifully and won’t skip frames during it. Finally, its run entirely within the browser 
                    meaning it’s more efficient and optimized allowing for it to run properly each time. This is a great way to improve your 
                    website without too much of a headache. Let’s get into the important functions needed to make the animation work.</p>
                
                   <p>&emsp;To understand CSS animation, you have to understand two key components that make the animation work. 
                    The first of these two components is the animation property. The animation property is used to set the timing of the 
                    animation so that it occurs during a set period of time. It also allows you to delay the animation set which direction it 
                    travels and how fast it moves between frames. It uses the following sub-properties.</p>
             
            <ul>

                <li> <u>animation-delay</u>:&nbsp;
                    Specifies the delay between an element loading and the start of an animation sequence and whether the animation 
                    should start immediately from its beginning or partway through the animation.
                </li>

                <li> <u>animation-direction</u>:&nbsp;
                    Specifies whether an animation's first iteration should be forward or backward and whether subsequent iterations should 
                    alternate direction on each run through the sequence or reset to the start point and repeat.
                </li>

                <li> <u>animation-duration</u>:&nbsp;
                    Specifies the length of time in which an animation completes one cycle.
                </li>

                <li> <u>animation-fill-mode</u>:&nbsp;
                    Specifies how an animation applies styles to its target before and after it runs.
                </li>

                <li> <u>animation-iteration-count</u>:&nbsp;
                    Specifies the number of times an animation should repeat.
                </li>

                <li> <u>animation-name</u>:&nbsp;
                	Specifies the name of the @keyframes at-rule describing an animation's keyframes.
                </li>

                <li> <u>animation-play-state</u>:&nbsp;
                	Specifies whether to pause or play an animation sequence.
                </li>

                <li> <u>animation-timing-function</u>:&nbsp;
                	Specifies how an animation transitions through keyframes by establishing acceleration curves.
                </li>

            </ul>
               
                <p> &emsp;Speaking of frames this brings us to the second most important feature of an animation the @keyframes rule. 
                This rule is what makes the animation look like an animation meaning it renders the animation at certain frames to make it 
                look animated. It does this through a percentage tag. This percentage tells us how far through the time of the frame before it
                changes the frame to a different one to animate it. This will make an element in the code appear like its spinning or sliding 
                in accordance with the what percent of the way through an animation time the keyframe is. Finally when you put it all together 
                you can do things like the animation below.</p>

                <p id="lastp">&emsp;This beautiful and simple animation was done easily through CSS code without too much effort and did 
                not require an outside coding language. This skill is very useful and I highly recommend even more research 
                on the process for those who are interested in becoming a Website Developer in the future. The above code deserves
                since it is not mine it belongs to Henrique Rodrigues the link where he posted this is in the read me.
