        <h2>Sum Ipsum from Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde</h2>

            <div>
                
                <p>“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: 
                    “I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, 
                    about three o’clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay 
                    through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be 
                    seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks asleep--
                    street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and 
                    all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of 
                    mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the 
                    sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a 
                    little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and 
                    the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard 
                    as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into 
                    one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the 
                    horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the 
                    child’s body and left her screaming on the ground. It sounds 
                    nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t like a man; 
                    it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa, took to 
                    my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where 
                    there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was 
                    perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so 
                    ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people
                     who had turned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, 
                     the doctor, for whom she had been sent put in his appearance. 
                     Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, 
                     according to the Sawbones; and there you might have supposed 
                     would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. 
                     I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had 
                     the child’s family, which was only natural. But the doctor’s 
                     case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary,
                      of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent 
                      and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest 
                      of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn 
                      sick and white with desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, 
                      just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the 
                      question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would 
                      make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end 
                      of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that 
                      he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were 
                      keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies.
                    
                </p>

                <p>   
                      I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, 
                      with a kind of black sneering coolness--frightened too, I could see that--but 
                      carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. 'If you choose to make capital out of 
                      this accident,’ said he, 'I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to 
                      avoid a scene,’ says he. 'Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed him up to a hundred 
                      pounds for the child’s family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there 
                      was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. 
                      The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but 
                      to that place with the door?--whipped out a key, went in, and presently came 
                      back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on 
                      Coutts’s, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention, 
                      though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well 
                      known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for 
                      more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my 
                      gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in 
                      real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with 
                      another man’s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and 
                      sneering. 'Set your mind at rest,’ says he, 'I will stay with you till the banks 
                      open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the doctor, and the child’s 
                      father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my 
                      chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. 
                      I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a 
                      forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine.”

                <br>“Tut-tut,” said Mr. Utterson.<br> 

                
                    “I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story.
                     For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really 
                     damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of 
                     the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your
                      fellows who do what they call good. Black mail I suppose; an honest 
                      man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth.
                       Black Mail House is what I call the place with the door, in 
                       consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,
                       ” he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing.

                    <br>From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: 
                    “And you don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”</br>
                
                </p>

                <p>“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. 
                    “But I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square 
                    or other.”

                   <br>“And you never asked about the--place with the door?” said Mr. 
                    Utterson.</

                   <br> “No, sir: I had a delicacy,” was the reply.
                     “I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too 
                     much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and 
                     it’s like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; 
                     and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland
                      old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head 
                      in his own back garden and the family have to change their name. 
                      No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street,
                       the less I ask.”</br>

                   <br>“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.

                   <br>“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. 
                    “It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody 
                    goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman
                     of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the 
                     first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. 
                     And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody 
                     must live there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so 
                     packed together about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends 
                     and another begins.”
                    
                </p>
